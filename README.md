This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

README should contain the following:

    Name of project
    Names and github handle for people on the team
    Description of project
    How to install the code locally
    How to use the app


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.


Deployment and QA

    Deployed to Heroku
    Follow the [bug report][./bug_reports.md] guidelines
    Add bugs to your Trello board and prioritize

Demos

Prior to demos (MVP or final), you should:

    deploy to heroku
    add links to github, heroku, and trello to the wiki
    set up travis ci and add link to it on the wiki (only for final demo)

Group Project Demos should include:

    description of the project and what problems it solves
    demo of the app and the functionality from heroku
    show simplecov test coverage
    each member goes around and talks about what they worked on and any challenges (technical or not) they faced, including showing code (this will not happen in the final project)
    discussion of the agile/team practices used -- trello, stand-ups, retros, estimation, TDD, CI, deployment etc
