This file should outline your agreements on pull request workflow and code review workflow, including who merges pull requests, and code style.

Pull Request Workflow

This workflow is required for the Group project.

Make sure to set your git user and email so you get credit for your work

    Create a branch named for the feature you are working on
    Write Code
    Commit your code and write a good commit message
    Push your branch and changes to your Github repository
    Create a Pull Request to your cohort organization



Code Review Workflow

    Another team mate reviews the pull request and writes code comments on Github
    You make the desired changes (using the Pull Request Workflow)
    Repeat #1-2 until teammate has no more changes that need to be made

Team should choose who merges Pull requests: code writer or the reviewer.



Getting changes
You'll need to get changes that other pairs. Use the upstream remote that we created earlier.

git pull upstream master


Code Style

For the final project, you can choose your own code style and pull-request workflow.

For the group project, use

    Styleguides
        AirBnB Ruby Styleguide
        AirBnB JavaScript Styleguide
    The code reviewer merges pull requests
